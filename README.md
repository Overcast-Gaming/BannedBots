# Banned Bots
A pretty simple concept. A list of bots that are banned from a [discord server with over 4000 bots](https://discord.gg/s3hQgN4aBN).
#### Contributing
You can report a bot ID along with a screenshot to anybody with the 'admemistrator' role. Other than that, you can't
#### Reasons
Bots will only be banned for a list of reasons. This list includes but it not limited to:

 - NSFW material
 - DM Spam (anything like [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/838157686465757215/987012560429674546/unknown.png))
 - DM Adverts (p2w minecraft servers)
 - DM Scams (fake nitro, etc)
 - On request by the owner
